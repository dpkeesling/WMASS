# For the next group

This project will need to be carried on by another group

## Future plans
### 1. Read from excel and shapefiles into a javascript object. Use that object to place objects on the map
- reference branches convert-json-to-class and excel-output-alexr. We were working on this in these branches, and you can continue on our work from there
### 2. Read in shapefiles and excel files dynamically

### 3. Make this software work without internet access
- Being that this software is going to be used in developing countries, there is slim chance of the end user having internet access. Mapbox API requires internet access. We need to either find an alternative to Mapbox, or find a way to make Mapbox work without internet access
